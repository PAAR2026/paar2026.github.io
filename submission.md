## Call for Papers/Submission

Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either an extended abstract (up to 8 pages) or a regular paper (up to 15 pages) [via HotCrp](https://submissions.floc26.org/paar/). Those limits are references excluded. Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which will select a balanced program of high-quality contributions. Short submissions that could stimulate fruitful discussion at the workshop are particularly welcome.

Submissions should be in PDF. Final versions should be prepared in LaTeX using the CEUR-WS.org style template [CEURART](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip) available at http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip (CEURART, one-column). An [Overleaf template is also available](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/hpvjjzhjxzjk). The papers are expected to be submitted through the central system of FLoC (see below). PAAR proceedings will be published electronically as CEUR workshop proceedings.
